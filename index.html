        <h3>Introduction: The Legendary Eldor</h3>
        <p>
          In a majestic forest, where trees whispered secrets and birds silently
          judged everyone, lived Eldor, the oldest moose alive. Some said he
          witnessed the invention of grass. Others believed he had an ongoing
          battle with gravity, explaining why he walked like his legs were
          questioning their life choices.

        <h3>
          The Great Migration (<i
            >or &ldquo;Why Is This River in My Way?&rdquo;</i
          >)
        </h3>
        <p>
          One chilly morning, the herd decided to move to a better grazing spot.
          The grass in their area had become boring—same taste, no innovation.
          As they traveled, they encountered a raging river (which was actually
          just an enthusiastic stream, but moose tend to exaggerate). The young
          moose Fern stopped in his tracks, eyes wide with fear.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          &ldquo;What if I slip? What if I get wet? What if my hooves look weird
          underwater?&rdquo;

        <h3>Eldor's Heroic (<i>and slightly Embarrassing</i>) Attempt</h3>
        <p>Eldor sighed, shaking his head.</p>
        <blockquote>
          "Back in my day, we didn't hesitate. We just crossed rivers… mostly
          because we didn't see them coming."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          With a deep breath, he stepped into the water—and instantly regretted
          it. The water was freezing, his knees popped like bubble wrap, and
          somewhere, a duck laughed at him.
        </p>

      <section id="victory">
        <h3>The Grand (<i>and Questionable</i>) Victory</h3>
        <p>
          Despite his dramatic suffering, Eldor made it across. Inspired by his
          questionable bravery, the herd followed, and even Fern took a leap of
          faith—mostly because he slipped on a rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they reached the other side, Eldor puffed out his chest and
          declared:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          "And THAT, my friends, is how a true moose handles a crisis."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then he promptly collapsed for a well-earned nap.</p>
